"""Hermetic wrapper for coordinating between worker and parent.

When we pass a string to a subprocess worker for execution, we need some
mechanism for the caller to monitor progress to know when execution is
complete, or if there was a failure. (And if so, what it was.)

To facilitate this communication, we define `_subprocess_snippet_handler`,
and then extract the source and re-define it in the worker.
